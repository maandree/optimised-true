NAME
	true - return true value
	false - return false value

SYNOPSIS
	true [ignored arguments]
	false [ignored arguments]

DESCRIPTION
	Optimised implementations of true(1p) and false(1p).
	true and false shall do nothing, successfully and
	unsuccessfully, respectively.

	If your microarchitecture is especially supported,
	true and false are implemented in assembler, without
	a C runtime and only requires one page of memory.

	If your microarchitecture is not especially supported,
	true and false are implemented in C using only a
	return statement in the main function. In this case,
	a C runtime is used which slows down the program
	significantly and it is usually required that somewhere
	around 400 KB to 800 KB of memory is used (that is
	about 150 pages.)

OPTIONS
	None.

EXIT STATUS
	true shall exit with the status 0.
	false shall exit with any value other than 0.
	In this implement false exits with the status 1.

RATIONALE
	None.

NOTES
	Your shell may have its own verions of true(1p)
	and false(1p).

BUGS
	None. These programs are about as simple as it gets.
